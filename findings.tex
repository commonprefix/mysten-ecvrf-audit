\subsubsection*{M01: Extra hashing in \lstinline{ecvrf_encode_to_curve}}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item[\textbf{Affected Code:}] \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L99}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 99)}
    \item[\textbf{Summary:}] In the \lstinline{ecvrf_encode_to_curve} implementation, the \lstinline{expand_message} function applies the hash once before returning the expanded message. Additionally, the \lstinline{map_to_point} function applies the hash once again before calling the function \lstinline{from_uniform_bytes}. However, the \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-16#name-hashing-to-ristretto255}{Hash-to-Curve RFC Appendix B} only hashes once before calling the \lstinline{from_uniform_bytes} function. This does not lead to any security issues but is a deviation from the specification and has negative performance implications.
    \item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] We recommend using \lstinline{from_uniform_bytes} directly in the \lstinline{ecvrf_encode_to_curve} to avoid the additional hashing and potential compatibility issues with other designs.
    \item[\textbf{Suggested Fix:}] \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/pull/543/commits/370694eeffed74a57c816758d472640e4011ae7e}{[370694]}

\subsubsection*{M-02: Non-canonical ristretto scalar deserialization}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
\item[\textbf{Affected Code:}] \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/groups/ristretto255.rs#L191}{fastcrypto/src/groups/ristretto255.rs (line 191)}
\item[\textbf{Summary:}] The ristretto scalar deserialization differs from the one upstream in that it does not enforce the value to be canonical (i.e that the input is already reduced). In the context of ECVRF this is not dangerous as the s,c components of a proof should *not* be assumed unique in any case. Proofs following the spec for nonce derivation are deterministic but this cannot be checked or enforced by the verifier: an alternative prover can derive k via other means with no clear avenue for detection. In general use however it can enable multiple representations for elements that should be unique, making replay attack detection harder.
\item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] Consider updating the ristretto scalar deserialization to use upstream \lstinline{from_canonical_bytes function}.
\item[\textbf{Suggested Fix:}] \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/pull/543/commits/ebcd7e1c8e6f0bbf48667f995017151a20289886}{[ebcd7e1c]}

\subsection{Low}
\subsubsection*{L-01: Consider removing \lstinline{verify_output} and bring \lstinline{verify} inline with the RFC}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item[\textbf{Affected Code:}] \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L45}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 45)}
    \item[\textbf{Summary:}] The \lstinline{verify_output} function allows the verification of an output given a proof, public key, input, and output. This function is not present in the RFC standard and its usage could lead to potential pitfalls. The function requires the purported output of the VRF as an input. There are two ways one can get the output: either by fetching it from someone or generating it locally by hashing the proof. The first scenario is a waste of bandwidth, as the output
    can be generated using the proof locally anyway. In the second scenario, we are generating the output twice: firstly to provide it as an input to the function, and, secondly, inside the \lstinline{verify_output} itself. Removing the \lstinline{verify_output} function would harden the implementation, as its use case is unclear. Additionally, the current \lstinline{verify} function returns a boolean, while the RFC specification returns False or (True, Output).
    \item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] Consider removing the \lstinline{verify_output} function and modify the \lstinline{verify} function to align with the RFC specification, returning False or (True, Output). This will help prevent potential issues for downstream developers.

\subsubsection*{L-02: Use of vartime multiscalar multiplication for faster verification}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
\item[\textbf{Affected Code:}] \
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L248}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 248)}
\item \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L252}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 252)}
\end{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Summary:}] Multiscalar multiplication takes the highest amount of time during verification. The current implementation uses \lstinline{RistrettoPoint::multiscalar_mul} which ensures a constant runtime to avoid leaking any information. However, the upstream \lstinline{RistrettoPoint} also allows for \lstinline{vartime_multiscalar_mul}, which is faster but does not run in constant time. \lstinline{vartime_multiscalar_mul} can be used for the verification side, where there is no private information that can be leaked.
\item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] Consider using \lstinline{vartime_multiscalar_mul} for the verification side to improve performance without risking the leakage of private information.
\item[\textbf{Suggested Fix:}] \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/pull/543/commits/53e16c8f82d63a84cdc842d93fc5c26cebbe109b}{[53e16c]}

\subsection{Informational}
\subsubsection*{I-01: Choice of \lstinline{SUITE_STRING} and \lstinline{DST}}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
\item[\textbf{Affected Code:}]\
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L78}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 78)}
\item \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L88}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 88)}
\end{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Summary:}] Currently, both \lstinline{SUITE_STRING} and \lstinline{DST} mention "sui". We understand that the fastcrypto library is primarily used for the Sui blockchain. We recommend using a more neutral identifier to encourage broader adoption of the implemented parameters.
\item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] Change the \lstinline{SUITE_STRING} and \lstinline{DST} identifiers to a more neutral term, such as "fastcrypto", to promote standardization and wider adoption of the library.

\subsubsection*{I-02: Consistent use of SHA512 reference type H}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
\item[\textbf{Affected Code:}]\
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L108}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 108)}
\item \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/963205c6d0538fe548b8b10037cf87a53af6f424/fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs#L137}{fastcrypto/src/vrf.rs (line 137)}

\end{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Summary:}] Some parts of the code use the reference type H of SHA512, while others directly use SHA512. It is recommended to use the reference type H consistently throughout the code.
\item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] Modify the code to consistently use the reference type H of SHA512, ensuring uniformity and improved maintainability.
\item[\textbf{Suggested Fix:}] \href{https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/pull/543/commits/d8edc92340dd957f4bd05c356379be7ffa0916a5}{[d8edc923]}

\subsubsection*{I-03: Dependency on curve25519-dalek-ng}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item[\textbf{Summary:}] The Ristretto255 implementation in the fastcrypto library depends on the \href{https://github.com/zkcrypto/curve25519-dalek-ng}{curve25519-dalek-ng} crate, which is a fork of the \href{https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek}{curve25519-dalek} crate. At the time of the audit, curve25519-dalek-ng is approximately 200 commits behind curve25519-dalek. This discrepancy may result in missed security updates, performance improvements, or other enhancements available in the original curve25519-dalek repository.
    \item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] We recommend reviewing the changes made in the curve25519-dalek repository since the fork and consider updating the dependency on curve25519-dalek-ng to include any relevant updates, bug fixes, or security patches. Alternatively, consider switching back to the original curve25519-dalek crate if the changes in curve25519-dalek-ng are no longer necessary or can be incorporated into the fastcrypto library in another way.

\subsubsection*{I-03: Adding Batch Verification Support}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item[\textbf{Summary:}] The current ECVRF implementation in the fastcrypto library does not support batch verification. Batch verification can improve the efficiency of verifying multiple VRF proofs simultaneously. The batchable VRF proofs, as described in the paper by Badertscher et al.\cite{batch-ecvrf} (\href{https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1045}{https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1045}), replaces the c component of the VRF proof with U,V as calculated by the prover. The verifier then derives c from the challenge generation function and checks two verification equations (as opposed to deriving two values U,V). By shifting the terms of the equations so they sum to zero, we can randomise them so that we only need to perform one (very long) multi-multiplication (and some field operations). These optimizations can also be combined with the variant multi-multiplication functions provided by Dalek. The main practical cost to this approach is that U,V are 32 bytes each instead of 16 bytes for c.
    \item[\textbf{Suggestion:}] We recommend exploring the addition of batch verification support to the ECVRF implementation in the fastcrypto library, following the approach described in the referenced paper. This could enhance the efficiency and performance of the library, particularly when verifying multiple VRF proofs at once.
